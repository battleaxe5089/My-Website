      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Dedicated and detail-oriented IT professional with a robust background in cybersecurity and project management. Holding a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of Missouri and several cybersecurity certifications, I have a comprehensive understanding of various security frameworks and best practices. My expertise includes proficiency in SQL Injection, Burp Suite, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), along with hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.

I have a proven track record of successfully managing and delivering projects using tools like Jira and GitHub, ensuring high-quality results and adherence to timelines. My technical skills encompass Python, C#, MySQL, Firebase, Swift, and MongoDB, which I have effectively utilized in various professional and academic projects.

In addition, I have developed an iOS application called SitesMobile for the University of Missouri’s Information Technology program’s Computing Sites organization. This project involved replacing the current system with an iOS app to streamline work task logging and progress tracking for employees and managers. The application features user authentication, live location and map functionalities, form submissions for productivity tasks, issue tracking, and image management.

I am seeking an entry-level position as a Penetration Tester, Security Analyst, or Vulnerability Assessment Analyst to leverage my technical skills and experience in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities. My goal is to contribute to a dynamic team where I can further develop my cybersecurity expertise and support the organization's security initiatives.</p>
